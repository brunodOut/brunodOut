# Who am I?
- 👋 Hi, I’m @brunodOut, also known as Bruno Moreira-Guedes
- 👀 I’m interested in cognitive science, linguistics, psycholinguistics and everything related to understanding this weird stuff called human mind
- I also restored my interest in programming, thanks to my dissertation
- 🌱 I’m currently a Master's Candidate pursuing my degree in Linguistics at UFFS (Federal University of Fronteira Sul, Brazil)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects (psych experiments)
- 📫 How to reach me: code -at- brunodOut -dot- dev  (join the parts sepparated by '@' and '.', so I can keep receiving no spam)
